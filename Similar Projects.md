1. [DocumentClassifier](https://github.com/conditionedstimulus/DocumentClassifier/tree/main)  
   - Only uses text for classification (can be improved to use tables and images too)  
   - OCR and classification are in the same service (should be separated into two services)


2.  [docTR](https://github.com/mindee/doctr)  
   - This provides a full-stack, end-to-end OCR solution that aligns directly with our projectâ€™s CORE Feature - Layout Analysis + OCR. It combines text detection, recognition, and even Key Information Extraction (KIE), making it ideal for extracting structured data from complex documents.
