1. [DocumentClassifier](https://github.com/conditionedstimulus/DocumentClassifier/tree/main)  
   - Only uses text for classification (can be improved to use tables and images too)  
   - OCR and classification are in the same service (should be separated into two services)


2.  [docTR](https://github.com/mindee/doctr)  
   - DocTR supports key features like layout analysis, OCR (text detection + recognition), and key information extraction. These features match well with our project goals, which involve understanding document structure and extracting important content from documents like invoices, receipts, and scientific papers.

3.  [DeepDoctection](https://github.com/deepdoctection/deepdoctection)
   -  This is a powerful Python library designed for document layout analysis, OCR, and information extraction, supporting both scanned images and PDFs. It integrates advanced models like Detectron2, Transformers, and DocTr to analyze document structure, recognize tables, and classify content. The library also supports RAG workflows by enabling extraction and indexing of document data for retrieval tasks. This aligns well with our projectâ€™s focus on automating document understanding and making documents searchable and usable.
